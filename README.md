### Informations    




`🔧` **Chronal Bot**  was created with the goal of _protecting_ your Discord server, so that users can enjoy this wonderful software in complete safety, avoiding raids and attempted destruction of Discord servers.

`🧰` Once the bot is on your discord and the **commands** are configured, you will have guaranteed protection on your Discord server.
     **There's more than 50+ commands!**

`📕` However, the bot also has controls to make your server more lively and enjoyable: a status-based support system, if you have a certain status then you will have a certain role. Perfect for community servers, right?

`📚` Regarding the upcoming orders, the bot is of course in `BETA` and is still in _development_, I encourage you to join the our **support server**, in order to be able to report _bugs_ and propose new _commands_.
